# Mapping Files
We also provide mapping files for both Fisher and Miami that map the files in the datasets to their respective splits in our data. `n/a` values in the `splits` columns mean that the instance was not used in our data (e.g. due to the lack of a translation, for example). For the Fisher corpus, the `audio_file` column refers to the audio file mappings in `LDC2010T04`, where the duration of each audio file is located (not included here, due to licensing).

These files may be useful if you are looking to do additional modifications beyond what this repository provides.
